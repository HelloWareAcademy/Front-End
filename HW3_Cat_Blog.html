      <h2>Happy birthday to me</h2>
      <h5><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-time"></span> Post by Marshmallow, Mar 20, 2018.</h5>
      <p>I am now 9 years old! Today, I was given extra food and lots of hugs and pets
	  from my owners. Then I decided to clean my fur to make it shiny.
	  I slept 12 hours during the day and decided to play at night, mostly with one of the owners' feet.</p>

      <h2>I've had better days...</h2>
      <h5><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-time"></span> Post by Marshmallow, Apr 27, 2018.</h5>
      <p>Today, I found a closet open and was able to find a straw broom.
	   It tasted good, but my stomach felt bad after. My owners did not seem happy with me.
	   They locked the broom away from me after that. No more broom.</p>

      <h2>Scary Monster!</h2>
      <h5><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-time"></span> Post by Marshmallow, May 24, 2018.</h5>
      <p>Every once in a while, this loud monster comes out of a closet and comes alive.
	  It eats crumbs on the floor. The monster is very hungry, it goes everywhere!
	  I jumped on the couch and kept an eye on the monster.
	  Finally the loud monster machine became quiet.</p>
